/*
 * lhook.dylib - the PID 1 bootstrap for system-wide injection.
 *
 * Loaded by dyld as an ordinary weak dependency of /sbin/launchd, not through
 * DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES. launchd strips DYLD_* from job environments and ignores it for
 * itself, but it cannot strip its own load commands. See LAUNCHD-PID1-HOOK.md.
 *
 * Two jobs:
 *   1. Prove it loaded, by writing a marker naming its own pid.
 *   2. Interpose posix_spawn and posix_spawnp so every process launchd starts inherits
 *      the injection, and so does everything they start.
 *
 * WHY THE INTERPOSE LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE PAYLOAD.
 * dyld resolves DYLD_INTERPOSE through __DATA,__interpose when an image is loaded, and it
 * does not retroactively rebind images that are already bound. A dylib dlopen'd later
 * therefore cannot interpose launchd's already-resolved posix_spawn calls. Only an image
 * present at launch can, and the load command is what makes this one present at launch.
 * This is also why ElleKit's own pspawn.dylib cannot be reused: it has no __interpose
 * section and hooks posix_spawn at runtime instead, which needs writable __TEXT and dies
 * with CODESIGNING / Invalid Page here.
 *
 * WHY THE POLICY LIVES IN THE PAYLOAD.
 * This file is on the sealed System volume. Changing it costs a DFU trip, so it must be
 * the part that never needs to change. Anything likely to be iterated on belongs in
 * kPayload, which is on the Data volume and can be replaced over SSH.
 *
 * SAFETY. This code runs inside PID 1 and on every spawn on the system. A mistake here is
 * not a crashed process, it is a device that does not boot. Four guards:
 *
 *   1. Nothing happens unless kEnableFile exists. It lives on /var/jb, which is NOT
 *      mounted while launchd is starting, so early boot is untouched for free and
 *      injection only begins once the system is up. Deleting the file over SSH, or from
 *      the ramdisk, disables everything.
 *   2. A denylist of processes that must never be touched.
 *   3. A missing payload means passthrough, rather than handing dyld a path that does not
 *      resolve, which would make every spawn on the system fail.
 *   4. Tracing is off unless kDebugFile exists. An fopen on every spawn out of launchd is
 *      both a performance problem and a way to deadlock early boot.
 *
 * Guard order matters: the enable file is checked first, so removing it disables
 * everything below with no further reasoning required.
