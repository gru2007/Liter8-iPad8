"""Prove a patched launchd differs from stock in exactly the intended places.

`codesign -v` passing says the signature is self-consistent. It does not say we
changed only what we meant to change. A stray write elsewhere in the file would
still validate, because the fixup recomputes whatever is there.

So this compares byte ranges instead. Four regions are expected to differ:

  offset 16          ncmds, one higher
  offset 20          sizeofcmds, larger by the command size
  end of commands    the appended LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB itself
  two code slots     SHA-256 of the header page and the command page

Anything else that differs is a bug, and this exits non-zero if it finds one.
