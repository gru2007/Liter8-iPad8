# fetch_payloads.sh - build every device payload from scratch, on the host.
#
# Run this before sshrd_provision.sh. It downloads the upstream releases,
# extracts the bundles, re-signs everything ad-hoc, and builds the local helper
# binaries from source. Output lands in payload/ and is what the provisioning
# script deploys.
#
# This exists because the payloads are build artifacts and are not committed.
# Without it a fresh clone cannot reproduce anything, and Sileo in particular
# used to be sourced from the device itself (installed by dpkg, pulled back,
# re-signed), which made provisioning depend on the device already being
# half-configured. Everything now comes from upstream.
#
#   ./fetch_payloads.sh                # the default set
#   ./fetch_payloads.sh sileo          # just one
#   ./fetch_payloads.sh debugserver    # optional, not in the default set
#
# Why every binary is re-signed ad-hoc:
#   Sileo ships flags=0x0 "no signature" with ZERO entitlements, because a real
#   jailbreak grants them via trust cache plus an amfid patch. As shipped it
#   dies on '/var/jb/usr/lib/libzstd.1.dylib (blocked by sandbox)'.
#   get-task-allow is never granted: AMFI kills ad-hoc binaries carrying it, so
#   Sileo's replacement entitlement set is written from scratch rather than
#   filtered from what it shipped with.
#
# TrollStore is deliberately NOT built here any more. It used to download
# opa334's TrollStore.tar, re-sign it, and rename the bundle to
# TrollStoreLite.app, which meant the device got the FULL build wearing a Lite
# name, with a helper that cannot register apps on iOS 27:
#   - registerApplicationDictionary: is a stub that always returns NO
#   - its replacement is entitlement-gated and the stock helper lacks the keys
#   - ldid was looked up on the wrong prefix
# It now installs after first boot from a deb, which also means it can be
# updated without another DFU trip, unlike anything placed on the sealed
# System volume. See COMMANDS.md, "TrollStore Lite (after first boot)".
