# Run on the HOST with the device booted into SSHRD. It stages payloads over
# ssh and runs the device-side work, then verifies. Every step is idempotent:
# re-running is safe and already-done steps are skipped, so this can be used
# both for a fresh restore and to top up a device after a partial run.
#
# The System volume is read-only on a normal boot, which is the only reason any
# of this needs SSHRD at all. Group it here so one trip does the lot.

# Sileo comes from payload/, built by fetch_payloads.sh from the upstream
# release. It used to be scraped off the device (installed via dpkg, then pulled
# back and re-signed), which made provisioning depend on the device already being
# half-configured and meant a fresh clone could not reproduce it.
#
# TrollStore used to be installed here too. It is not any more: anything placed
# in /Applications lives on the sealed System volume and cannot be updated
# without another DFU trip, and the build that went here was the full TrollStore
# renamed to TrollStoreLite.app, whose helper cannot register apps on iOS 27.
# It now installs after first boot from a deb. See COMMANDS.md.
