The four guard values live in the encrypted root filesystem, and the only
other code that opens it, `rootfs.py`, sits behind `fw prepare-rootfs`, which
refuses without a profile. That is circular for a board being added, so this
reads the same values straight from an extracted IPSW and prints a profile to
paste. It measures and reports; it never writes to the firmware tree.
