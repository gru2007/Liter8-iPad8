# iOS 27 RC `24A435` (iPhone 11 / n104ap): patch-by-patch port from beta 4

Extension document for adding `24A435` support to a tree that already supports `24A5390f`. For every patch the beta-4 build uses, it records the RC offset, whether the opcode changed, what changed, and how it is patched.

Branch: `ios-27-rc-support`

## Status

**RC resolves all 198 patch records the beta-4 fixtures cover, all 18 have exact-build oracles, and the complete workflow is device-validated.** An erase restore, SSHRD provisioning, normal boot and repeat boot passed on an iPhone 11 (`n104ap`). Post-boot checks confirmed root SSH, Procursus, persona 99, the icon token and the persistent PosterBoard wallpaper repair watcher.

|                    | beta 4 `24A5390f` | RC `24A435` |
| ------------------ | ----------------: | ----------: |
| Fixture plans      |                18 |      **18** |
| Patch records      |               198 |     **198** |
| Fixtures verifying |                18 |      **18** |

Both builds are resolved with the same resolver binary, so the two sides are directly comparable.

| Category                                            | Count |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----: |
| `offset only`: opcode byte-identical, offset moved |   158 |
| `ORIG CHANGED`: RC original bytes differ           |    12 |
| `REPL CHANGED`: replacement is build-derived       |     4 |
| `ORIG+REPL`: both differ                           |     4 |
| `identical`: same offset _and_ bytes               |     2 |
| `NOT RESOLVED`                                      | **0** |

Two composite plans that have no fixture of their own also resolve: `kernel boot` (154 records) and `kernel boot-public` (119 records).

### Regression state

All 18 beta-4 fixtures verify unchanged, including `testCompatibilityKernelPlanCompositionAgainstBeta4Oracle`, which pins byte-for-byte agreement with the independent public Python `apply_patches.py` output. **No beta-4 fixture was modified**; see [the landing-pad decision](#decision-beta-4-stays-byte-identical-rc-keeps-its-pads).

### Workflow validation

The RC profile is registered as reviewed after exact-device validation on 2026-09-13. Normal firmware commands select it without `--experimental`.

## How to read the tables

| Category | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `offset only` | RC original bytes byte-identical to beta 4 | None |
| `ORIG CHANGED` | RC original bytes differ | Never transplant the beta-4 word; the pre-image guard would reject it |
| `REPL CHANGED` | Replacement is re-encoded per build | None; it is computed |
| `ORIG+REPL` | Both differ | As above |

## The defining RC change: BTI is enabled in the kernelcache

Apple turned on Branch Target Identification for the RC kernelcache. Most functions now begin with a `BTI C` landing pad (`0xD503245F`) **one word before** the `PACIBSP` that every resolver treated as the function start.

| Build | `BTI C` immediately followed by `PACIBSP` | total `PACIBSP` |
| --- | --: | --: |
| beta 4 `24A5390f` | **0** | 112050 |
| RC `24A435` | **87629** | 109000 |

IDA's own analysis of the RC kernelcache agrees and puts it more strongly: of 190337 functions it recognises, **140862 start with `BTI C`** and only 13233 start with `PACIBSP`. The higher number is expected. It includes functions that have a pad but no PAC prologue.

```asm
; beta 4                    ; RC 24A435
pacibsp                     bti     c          <- a BL lands HERE now
sub     sp, sp, #N          pacibsp
                            sub     sp, sp, #N
```

One beta-4 exception is worth knowing: `performLoggingLevelQueryGated` already began with `BTI C` on beta 4. BTI is not new to the architecture, only newly pervasive.

TXM did **not** change this way. All nine TXM patches resolve unchanged.

### Two different addresses, and the distinction that matters

A BTI build splits one concept into two:

|  | Address | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **entry** | the `BTI C` | what a `BL` targets, what a function pointer stores, boundary arithmetic |
| **prologue** | the `PACIBSP` | where a two-instruction stub must be written |

Conflating them breaks things in _both_ directions, and both were observed:

- Using the prologue as the entry collapses scan windows and makes predecessor checks read the pad. That was the original cause of two blockers.
- Using the entry as the stub target **destroys the landing pad**, which under BTI enforcement faults on the first indirect branch.

`ARM64.functionEntry` / `ARM64.functionStart` answer the first question, `ARM64.stubStart` answers the second. On a build without pads both collapse back to the same address, which is why beta 4 is unaffected.

### Is BTI actually enforced?

**Not determined.** Enforcement lives in `SCTLR_EL1.BT0`/`BT1`, and the RC kernelcache contains no writes to `SCTLR_EL1`. On SPTM-era devices that register is programmed by SPTM, which is a separate binary not present here.

So the risk of overwriting a pad is **unquantified, not disproven**. Every stub in this tree now preserves pads regardless, because doing so is free: the patched function becomes `bti c; <stub>` instead of `<stub>`, which is correct either way.

## Blocker 1 (resolved): AMFI post-validation compare had inverted polarity

**This was the one place where the beta-4 replacement word would have been actively wrong on RC.**

### Locating it

The anchor `AMFI: code signature validation failed` occurs exactly once in RC, at `0x65143d`. Its three ADRP+ADD references all sit in one function at `0x1f05b58` (1645 words, 71 direct callees). Searching RC for the beta-4 shape `tbz w?,#0x1a ; mov x0,x23 ; bl` returns exactly one hit, `0x1f0896c`, inside callee `0x1f0892c`.

### Why the resolver had found nothing

`KernelAMFIResolver` scanned each callee with `cursor = callee + 8` up to `nextFunctionStart(after: callee, 0x200)`. In RC the callee is the `BTI C` and `nextFunctionStart` looked only for `PACIBSP`, four bytes later, so `end` landed before `cursor` and the loop never ran.

IDA confirms the boundary independently: it reports the function as `0xfffffff008f0c92c .. 0xfffffff008f0ca64`, i.e. **starting at the BTI**, exactly the address the resolver was treating as belonging to the previous function.

### Correspondence evidence

Beta-4 `0x1f3c708` and RC `0x1f0892c` are the same function:

- identical argument shuffle `x19=x6, x20=x5, x22=x4, x25=x3, x24=x2, x23=x1, x21=x0`
- identical `tbz w2, #0x1a` gate on the same bit
- identical authenticated dispatch, including PAC discriminators `movk x17,#0xcda1,lsl#48` and `movk x16,#0x2e3b,lsl#48`, and vtable displacement `mov x17,#0x138`
- same diagnostic string family: `com.apple.private.oop-jit.loader`, `%s: %s disallowed due to OOP-JIT loader entitlement.`, `%s: %s disallowed due to OOP-JIT runner entitlement.`
- IDA independently resolves the fallthrough string reference as `aSHashTypeIsSha ; "%s: Hash type is SHA1"`

Only the frame size differs (`#0x70` beta 4, `#0x60` RC).

### The semantic change

```asm
; beta 4, site 0x1f3c750               ; RC, site 0x1f08978
tbz     w2, #0x1a, 0x1f3c758           tbz     w2, #0x1a, 0x1f08990
mov     x0, x23                        mov     x0, x23
bl      0x1f550f0                      bl      0x1f21878
cmp     w0, #2          <- SITE        cmp     w0, #1          <- SITE
b.ne    0x1f3c800   ; -> REJECT        b.ne    0x1f08990   ; -> ACCEPT
                                       str     x22, [sp]
                                       adrp    x3, "%s: Hash type is SHA1."
                                       b       0x1f08a34   ; -> REJECT
```

Beta 4 rejects when the hash type is **not** SHA256. RC rejects when it **is** SHA1. The branch sense is reversed.

Beta 4's replacement `cmp w0,w0` (`1f00006b`) sets Z, so `b.ne` is never taken and control falls through to accept. The identical word at the RC site also sets Z, `b.ne` is still never taken, but in RC the fallthrough **is** the SHA1 rejection block, so the patch would refuse every binary.

### Fix

`postValidationCompare` now derives the replacement from the branch sense rather than assuming beta 4's. It inspects the six words after the conditional branch: a rejection block materialises a format string with an `ADRP` and then branches to the shared logging tail, while the accept path continues into an authenticated vtable dispatch and contains neither.

| Build | Fallthrough | Replacement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| beta 4 | accept path | `1f00006b`: `cmp w0,w0`, forces EQ (unchanged) |
| RC | reject path | `ff070071`: `cmp wzr,#1`, forces NE so the accept branch is taken |

`0x710007FF` is `SUBS WZR, WZR, #1`: `0 - 1` leaves Z clear, so the `b.ne` at `0x1f0897c` is unconditional.

## Blocker 2 (resolved): `isDeviceInRestoreMode`

The anchor was always healthy. The cluster `…111\0rd\0rootdev\0-restore\0%02X` occurs exactly once, at `0x810e11`, and its `rd` literal has three ADRP+ADD references.

`KernelBootPolicyResolver` required `RETAB` at `functionStart - 4`. In RC that word is the `BTI C` pad for all three candidates, so all three were rejected:

| Candidate   | `start - 8`       | `start - 4`          | `start`            |
| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| `0x28053d0` | `d65f0fff` retab  | `d503245f` **bti c** | `d503237f` pacibsp |
| `0x28a628c` | `d4200020` brk #1 | `d503245f` **bti c** | `d503237f` pacibsp |
| `0x28aa0cc` | `d65f0fff` retab  | `d503245f` **bti c** | `d503237f` pacibsp |

IDA confirms all three: `starts_at_BTI: true` for every one.

Fixed by routing the search through `ARM64.functionStart`, which returns the pad as the entry, so `entry - 4` reads the previous function's terminator again.

## Blocker 3 (resolved): `current_thread_ro`, an over-constrained signature

Not a BTI problem. The 8-word signature matched beta 4 uniquely at `0x32a2b80` and RC zero times. Bisecting: 5 words matched RC uniquely at `0x323590c`, 8 did not. Exactly one word differed:

```text
ok   0x323590c  want d503237f/ffffffff  found d503237f
ok   0x3235910  want a9bf7bfd/ffffffff  found a9bf7bfd
ok   0x3235914  want 910003fd/ffffffff  found 910003fd
ok   0x3235918  want d538d080/ffffffff  found d538d080
ok   0x323591c  want f9400001/ffc003ff  found f9420401
ok   0x3235920  want 90000008/9f00001f  found d0fecca8
DIFF 0x3235924  want 9107c108/ffffffff  found 91034108
ok   0x3235928  want a9402109/ffffffff  found a9402109
```

```asm
; beta 4                        ; RC
adrp x8, 0xbc3000               adrp x8, 0xbcb000
add  x8, x8, #0x1f0             add  x8, x8, #0xd0
ldp  x9, x8, [x8]               ldp  x9, x8, [x8]
```

The global moved pages. `MaskedInstructionPattern` already masked the ADRP page, but `allowDataLayoutDrift` relaxed only unsigned-offset `LDR`/`STR`, so the signature pinned the low 12 bits of an address that is free to move.

Fixed by extending `allowDataLayoutDrift` to `ADD (immediate, 64-bit, LSL #0)` with the same `0xFFC003FF` mask already used for load/store displacements.

**IDA cross-check:** `sub_FFFFFFF00A23990C` (file offset `0x323590c`) has **771 callers**, a hot leaf helper, which is what `current_thread_ro` should be.

A second, independent break then appeared in the same plan: the `mpc_ops` slots store the address a call lands on, which in RC is the pad, so the resolver's `PACIBSP` guard on `file_check_mmap` failed. Every one of those five hooks is reached _only_ through that table, i.e. always indirectly, so the stubs now start at the prologue and keep their pads.

## Blocker 4 (resolved): AppleCredentialManager, all 26 methods

Located in RC by masked prologue matching, then verified in IDA.

- **Segment:** every hit lies in `com.apple.driver.AppleSEPCredentialManager:__text`.
- **Order:** the 26 RC offsets appear in exactly beta 4's relative order. That is the cross-check that this is the same set and not 26 coincidences.
- **Match quality:** 21 of 26 matched their full beta-4 signature exactly and uniquely. `updateAnalytics` and `unlockItem` share an identical 32-word prologue and were separated by position. `performCommandGated` (12/16), `sendSEPCommand` (27/32) and `setPowerStateGated` (19/32) matched partially and were placed by the resolver's existing neighbour-bounded scoring.

**All 26 RC methods carry a `BTI C` pad, and ten of them have zero direct branch references**. They are reached only through a taken address:

`sepManagerMatchedThreadCallHandler`, `callPlatformFunction`, `cmdContextV2`, `performCommandGated`, `_setPropertiesGated`, `performDoubleClickQueryGated`, `performLoggingLevelQueryGated`, `handleSEPMessage`, `powerOffActionGated`, `sepManagerMatchedGated`.

For those ten the beta-4 approach of overwriting the first two instructions would remove the only legal indirect-branch target. All 26 stubs now start at the prologue instead.

The RC signature family `ios27-24A435-acm-v1` is recorded in `Sources/Liter8Core/Profiles/KernelCredentialManagerSignatures.swift` and its `pendingResearch` gate is lifted. The families deliberately stay separate rather than being merged behind a looser mask.

## Blocker 5 (resolved): iBSS normal boot-args slot

`ibss-restore` and `ibss-ramdisk` resolved a slot at `0x26cfc0`; `ibss-normal` did not.

### What the runs actually look like

Every zero run ending on a 4 KiB boundary, both builds:

|  | largest run | runner-up | total page-tail runs |
| --- | --- | --- | --: |
| beta 4 `24A5390f` | `0xd0e24..0xd1000`, **476 bytes** | `0x119fdd..0x11a000`, 35 bytes | 62 |
| RC `24A435` | `0x26cfb1..0x26d000`, **79 bytes** | `0x125fdd..0x126000`, 35 bytes | 42 |

| Plan | Literal | Bytes with NUL | Runs with room (incl. 8-byte guard) |
| --- | --- | --: | --- |
| restore | `-v wdt=-1 rd=md0 -restore` | 26 | **2** on both builds |
| SSHRD | `rd=md0 -v wdt=-1 debug=0x2014e backlight-level=1024` | 52 | 1 |
| normal | `-v debug=0x2014e launchd_unsecure_cache=1 wdt=-1 backlight-level=1024` | 70 | 1 |

### Two bugs, not one

The original code computed `writeOffset = (runStart + 8 + 15) & ~15` and kept every run where the literal then fitted, requiring the survivor to be unique.

1. On RC that 16-byte-aligned position leaves 64 usable bytes in a 79-byte run, so the 70-byte normal literal did not fit and no slot was found.
2. Relaxing the alignment to fix (1) exposed a second, worse problem. The strict 16-byte rule had been acting as a **selectivity filter**, not just an alignment convention: `0x119fdd + 8` rounded up to 16 is `0x119ff0`, and `0x119ff0 + 26` overruns `0x11a000`, so the 35-byte runner-up was excluded from the restore plan _by arithmetic accident_. With a narrower alignment it fitted, two candidates appeared, and `ibss-restore` began failing on **both** builds with an ambiguity error.

### The semantic fix

Identify the run by what it is (the section-tail padding, i.e. the uniquely largest page-boundary zero run) and only then place the literal inside it. Selection no longer depends on literal length at all, which is what made it unstable. Both payloads have one clearly dominant run (476 vs 35; 79 vs 35), so requiring a unique maximum is a stronger identity than any fit test.

Placement inside that run keeps the 8-byte guard after the last real section contents and then takes the widest alignment from 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 that fits. Alignment is a convention rather than a requirement: the slot holds a NUL-terminated C string read by a byte copy, and ADRP+ADD addresses any byte in the page. The guard gap is never traded away.

### Result

| Plan    | beta 4    | RC         |
| ------- | --------- | ---------- |
| restore | `0xd0e30` | `0x26cfc0` |
| SSHRD   | `0xd0e30` | `0x26cfc0` |
| normal  | `0xd0e30` | `0x26cfba` |

Beta 4 is unchanged on all three. The roomy run still satisfies 16-byte alignment. RC's normal literal lands at 2-byte alignment and ends exactly on the page boundary.

## Decision: beta 4 stays byte-identical; RC keeps its pads

Preserving landing pads initially moved one beta-4 record, and I first decided to regenerate the fixture. That was wrong, and the test that caught it says why:

> This digest was produced independently by the public Python `apply_patches.py kc-boot` table. Matching it proves that the Swift compatibility plan changes the same bytes, not merely 119 bytes.

The beta-4 byte sequence is an independent cross-implementation check between the Swift resolvers and the public Python patcher. Breaking it to guard against unproven BTI enforcement on a _different_ build is a bad trade.

### The discriminator

`BTI C` **followed by `PACIBSP`** is a landing pad the compiler emitted in front of a prologue. A bare `BTI C` that begins a PAC-less leaf is the function's own first instruction.

```asm
; a pad in front of a prologue      ; a PAC-less leaf whose first
; -- the stub goes after it         ; instruction happens to be BTI C
bti     c                           bti     c
pacibsp                             cbz     x1, <end>
sub     sp, sp, #N                  mov     w0, #0
```

`ARM64.stubStart` only skips the first shape. That single condition gives both properties at once.

### Result

|  | outcome |
| --- | --- |
| beta 4 `24A5390f` | **byte-identical**, all 13 available fixtures verify, Python cross-check intact |
| RC `24A435`, `kernel restore` | 20 records, **0** overwrite a pad |
| RC, `kernel boot-policy` | 4 records, **0** overwrite a pad |
| RC, `kernel sandbox` | 46 records, **0** overwrite a pad |
| RC, `kernel credential-manager` | 52 records, **1** overwrites a pad |

### The one residual case

`performLoggingLevelQueryGated` has the PAC-less-leaf shape on **both** builds (`bti c; cbz x1; mov w0,#0; …`), so on RC its stub is still written at the `BTI`. On RC that method has zero direct branch references and one address-taken reference, so it is reached indirectly, which under enforced BTI would fault.

This is a known, bounded risk rather than an oversight:

- beta 4 patches this exact method the same way and boots.
- BTI enforcement could not be confirmed either way (see [open questions](#open-questions)).
- Making it pad-safe requires either a three-word stub or shifting the record, and both change beta 4.

If RC turns out to enforce BTI, this is the first place to look, and the fix is local to one method.

## Why the workflow profile is reviewed

The 18 fixtures pin all 198 patch records and their output hashes. The profile also pins the stock launchd hash, service-cache hash and daemon count, and the class-owned Setup method count. The remaining gate was physical validation; on 2026-09-13 the iPhone 11 completed erase restore, SSHRD provisioning, normal boot and repeat boot. `finalize --check` then confirmed root SSH, bootstrap shells, persona 99, the icon token and the PosterBoard watcher.

## Tests added

All synthetic, so they run without any firmware present. Each pins a rule rather than a build's offsets.

| Suite | Cases | Covers |
| --- | --: | --- |
| `ARM64BoundaryTests` | 11 | `functionEntry` with and without a pad; `functionStart` returning the call target rather than the prologue; `nextFunctionStart` refusing to report a function's own prologue (the window collapse); `stubStart` skipping a pad only when a `PACIBSP` follows it, and leaving a bare `BTI C` leaf alone |
| `MaskedInstructionPatternDriftTests` | 4 | `ADD (immediate)` drift accepted with `allowDataLayoutDrift`, rejected without it, and rejected for a changed register or a shifted `ADD` |
| `AMFIPostValidationPolarityTests` | 4 | both polarities of the post-validation compare, that the two replacements differ, and that a zero immediate is refused rather than silently emitting a no-op |
| `IBSSBootArgsSlotTests` | 10 | page-boundary-only run detection, dominance over the runner-up run, literal length not affecting run choice, tied runs refused, widest-alignment preference, narrowing only when the run demands it, and the guard gap never being traded away |
| `FirmwareProfileTests` | profile coverage | the RC ACM family is distinct and both device-validated workflows remain reviewed |
| `ReleaseFixtureTests` | 2 | all 18 RC fixtures rediscover their sites and output hashes; RC and beta-4 manifests cover the same patch-id set per resolver |

## Per-patch tables

RC offsets are payload-relative against the decompressed payloads hashed below.

### iBSS / iBEC

The boot-args slot and the ADRP/ADD that point at it differ per plan, so those rows are listed per plan rather than once.

Note `coreauthd.dto-ratchet.start-controller` sits at the **same offset** on both builds with a **different** `BL` displacement, and both `ctkd` records are identical in offset and bytes. Neither is a reason to transplant: the guarded applier checks the pre-image, and a resolver that happened to be right here would still be wrong on the next build.

---

## RC fixtures

All 18 exact-build oracles live in `fixtures/24A435/n104ap/`. Each binds the clean input SHA-256, every resolved offset with its original and replacement bytes, and the SHA-256 of the complete patched output.

They are generated by `liter8 fixture`, which runs the same resolver and the same `GuardedPatchApplier` the CLI uses everywhere else, then reloads the manifest and verifies it against the input before reporting success. Nothing in a fixture is hand-transcribed.

```sh
liter8 fixture kernel restore <kernelcache> fixtures/24A435/n104ap/kernel-restore-n104-24A435.json \
    --device "iPhone 11" --board n104ap --build 24A435 \
    --component-name kernelcache.release.iphone12b
```

**198 records total.** Truncated hashes above are for reading; the manifests carry them in full.

`ReleaseFixtureTests` verifies every one and additionally checks that the RC and beta-4 manifests describe the same patch-id set per resolver, that each RC manifest pins an output hash, and that no RC manifest accidentally points at a beta-4 binary. It sits in the slow tier with `KernelFixtureTests`:

```sh
LITER8_FIXTURE_ROOT=/path/to/private/research make test-fixtures
```

Apple binaries stay out of the repository. The suite reads them from `<fixture root>/offsets/24A435/` and skips cleanly when they are absent.

**iBSS and iBEC are byte-identical on RC**, as on beta 4. Verified by matching SHA-256 and by `cmp` finding no differing byte. The container hashes differ only because the IM4P wrappers carry different four-character types.

`liter8 profile` on the RC kernelcache selects `ios27-24A435-n104ap` unaided, and the embedded XNU fingerprint matches the value already in the profile.

Derived three ways that agree: `otool -l`, `liter8 inspect segments`, and IDA. The kernelcache is stripped (`nm` reports 728 symbols, none of them targets), so every kernel patch is recovered by code shape.

```

## Device-validation result

The reviewed workflow gate is complete. The physical n104ap run verified:

1. CFW construction and guarded post-patch records for all six restore artifacts.
2. Erase restore with a managed TSS proxy and captured restore-bound APTicket.
3. SSHRD construction, boot, bootstrap installation and rootfs provisioning.
4. Setup.app, userland crash fixes, ScreenTime overrides, launchd injection, service cache, Dropbear, Sileo and per-boot tools through the on-device check.
5. Normal boot and repeat normal boot, followed by a successful `finalize --check`.

The first normal boot exposed one RC-specific wallpaper failure. `pfwatch` started before its old `~/Library/SpringBoard` log directory existed, and `pfruntimeprobe` derived its dyld slide from a beta-4 PosterFoundation address. The durable fix uses early-boot-safe log and lock paths and decodes the live ARM64 `ADRP`/`LDR` pairs to locate the adjacent dispatch-once and object slots. It fails closed until the globals initialize. A forced PosterBoard restart proved that the watcher detects the new PID, waits for initialization, repairs the dictionary and passes readback; the following normal boot retained the wallpaper.

### Exact-build inputs retained by the reviewed profile

| APFS volume label | `Rave24A435.N104OS` |

These values remain guards, not substitute offsets. Component offsets continue to come from the semantic resolvers and are checked against the RC fixtures.

## Open questions

1. **Is BTI enforced?** Not answerable from the kernelcache; `SCTLR_EL1` is programmed by SPTM, which is a separate binary. Pads are preserved everywhere regardless, which costs nothing.
2. **`setPowerStateGated` confidence.** It matched 19/32 words and was placed by neighbour-bounded scoring rather than a unique exact match. It is the least certain of the 26 ACM methods.
3. **AKS selector-7 ABI.** The RC `externalMethod` dispatch and its calling convention have not been re-checked against the transplanted payload; the support plan asks for that explicitly.

---

## Pre-boot work: Setup.app, launchd, service cache, APTicket

These inputs now have exact-build guards and local dry-run verification. The remaining evidence must come from the physical-device workflow.

### Setup.app: class ownership recovers the beta-4 set

The broad `__objc_methlist` scan produced 81 beta-4 and 82 RC candidates. Even a structurally correct global method-list walk still produced 79 beta-4 candidates. Those counts are not the patch rule because the section contains valid method lists that are not installed as base methods of a class in this image.

`device/patch_setup.py` now begins at `__objc_classlist` and follows the runtime ownership chain:

- each classlist pointer and `class_ro_t` must resolve through chained fixups;
- `baseMethods` must reference a valid relative `method_list_t` with `entsize == 12` and bounds wholly inside `__objc_methlist`;
- The `name` field of a relative entry is a delta to a **selector-reference slot**, not to the string. The binary uses chained fixups, so that slot is decoded before resolving into `__TEXT,__objc_methname`;
- the type must be `B16@0:8`, and the IMP must land inside `__TEXT,__text`.

Every classlist entry resolves on both binaries: 449 of 449 on beta 4 and 452 of 452 on RC.

| selection rule                         | beta 4 |     RC |
| -------------------------------------- | -----: | -----: |
| broad method-list candidates           |     81 |     82 |
| **class-owned `controllerNeedsToRun`** | **65** | **66** |

The class-owned beta-4 result exactly reproduces the 65 methods already proven on the device, without consulting offsets. RC preserves those 65 owning classes and adds one: `BuddyServicesTermsFlow`. The workflow therefore patches 66 on RC and refuses to write if the selected profile's expected count differs.

The patcher can also emit a JSON record containing each class, IMP, file offset, original bytes and replacement. This leaves a reviewable pre-image trail for a behavioural patch that must never silently broaden.

### launchd: `/usr/lib/lhook.dylib` is the only option that fits

> Superseded: iPadOS 26.7.1 `23H30` launchd has 40 bytes of slack, a
> 15-character budget, so the hook now lives at `/usr/lib/lhook` (40-byte
> command) on every build. The analysis below is unchanged otherwise.

|  | value |
| --- | --- |
| RC `/sbin/launchd` | 639376 bytes |
| SHA-256 | `c640246d38aaeb2d2372aff1e5aa0de59dec267f53c0dfc155f7837e717af68b` |
| Mach-O UUID | `CA54230D-4005-3131-8DC3-CCB7E7EF18E6` |
| load commands | 27, `sizeofcmds` 4408 |
| header + commands end | `0x1158` |
| first section file offset | `0x1188` |
| **free header slack** | **48 bytes** |
| `LC_RPATH` | **absent** |

A `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB` is 24 bytes fixed plus path and NUL, padded to 8, so the path budget is 24 bytes, or 23 characters.

| path | size | verdict |
| --- | --: | --- |
| `/usr/lib/systemhook.dylib` | 56 | too long |
| `@loader_path/lhook.dylib` | 56 | too long |
| `@rpath/lhook.dylib` | 48 | **ruled out: no `LC_RPATH` in this binary** |
| **`/usr/lib/lhook.dylib`** | **48** | **fits exactly** |

Both paths the support plan names are too long. `@rpath` was checked and rejected rather than assumed: `otool -l` reports no `LC_RPATH` load command, so an `@rpath` install name would not resolve. `/usr/lib/lhook.dylib` consumes the slack exactly, leaving none.

The same patch/re-sign/byte-diff verifier was run against pristine beta-4 and RC launchd binaries. Both produced valid code slots and only the intended header, load-command and CodeDirectory changes. RC consumes all 48 bytes of header slack, so the install name must remain `/usr/lib/lhook.dylib`.

### Service cache

`/System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist`, binary plist, 2474924 bytes, SHA-256 `752739f8224b016b5cee1b37a985995ffcfc1d6f12569fd2191ba5b4a9119c6a`.

| key                      |                       entries |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------: |
| `SystemLibraryTreeState` |                          3478 |
| `AppExtensions`          |                           782 |
| `LaunchDaemons`          | **729** (724 distinct labels) |
| `AppRemovalServices`     |                            16 |
| `Symlinks`               |                             1 |
| `VersionNumber`          |                             7 |

Jobs are keyed by source plist path; each value carries `Label`, `Program`, `MachServices` and friends. `com.dropbear` and `com.jbboot` are absent, as expected. They are what the rebuild inserts.

There is a **signature sidecar**, `launchd.plist.sig`, 19661 bytes. Provisioning requires it to be present and deliberately leaves it untouched, matching the beta-4 path under `launchd_unsecure_cache=1`.

**Finding on the ScreenTime overrides.** Four of the five labels the support plan lists are present as LaunchDaemons:

| label | source |
| --- | --- |
| `com.apple.ScreenTimeAgent` | `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ScreenTimeAgent.plist` |
| `com.apple.ScreenTimeSettingsAgent` | `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ScreenTimeSettingsAgent.plist` |
| `com.apple.FamilyControlsAgent` | `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.FamilyControlsAgent.plist` |
| `com.apple.familycircled` | `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.familycircled.plist` |
| `com.apple.familynotificationd` | **not in this cache** |

This cache holds no `LaunchAgents` key, so `com.apple.familynotificationd` is either a per-user agent cached elsewhere or absent from RC entirely. The plan's acceptance check asks that all five labels be exactly `true` in `/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/disabled.plist`; writing an override for a label that does not exist is harmless, but the check as written cannot be satisfied from this cache alone and should be re-read against the Data volume.

### APTicket: captured and verified during device restore

A ticket is issued by Apple's TSS during a restore and is bound to this device's ECID and the build's nonce. There is nothing to resolve, extract or verify from the IPSW.

The handling code is build-agnostic: `scripts/apticket.py` performs DER/IM4M validation and atomic publication, while `scripts/capture_ticket.py` recovers the ticket from a completed restore log. Neither required an RC-specific implementation.

The physical-device RC restore captured and verified the restore-bound ticket before SSHRD and normal-boot artifacts were built.

## Appendix: resolver evidence per record

Every record here is one from the per-patch tables, with the evidence its resolver emitted for choosing that site. Evidence is what makes a record auditable: it names the semantic identity that was matched, not the address the match happened to land on. A record whose evidence no longer holds on a future build should fail loudly rather than drift to a neighbouring function.

Records are grouped where they share an evidence set, which is the normal case for a paired result/return stub or a multi-word generated payload. The 198 records reduce to 56 distinct evidence sets.

Produced by `liter8 resolve <component> <plan> <binary> --json` against the same RC payloads the fixtures pin. Every offset and byte pair was checked to match `fixtures/24A435/n104ap/` exactly, so this appendix describes the same 198 records and not a re-run that drifted.
